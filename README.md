# Implementation-of-Regular-Expression-using-state-transition-table
Implemented a C++ program for the regular expression 2?0+1[2]* over the alphabet {0,1,2}. The program takes a character string of arbitrary length as input and returns a copy to a new string that is the first longest match to the regular expression. The match must begin with the first character.
